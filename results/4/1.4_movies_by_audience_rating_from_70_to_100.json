It is little remembered that these young women led the historic first strike by African American performers. They walked out of the Apollo one Saturday night in a successful bid for higher wages and established the American Guild of Variety Artists, for black and white performers nationwide. The Silver Belles have rich stories to tell about the history they made dancing at Harlem's legendary venues--the Cotton Club, Connie's Inn, Small's Paradise. They toured the world, were honored abroad, and danced on the first black USO tour (when they stole the \"for colored only\" signs off the trains they rode in America's Jim Crow south). When the big band era ended, and with it the need for show dancers, they went into other work, until they put their shoes back on in 1985, and kept on dancing. Now aged 84 to 96, they have been performing together to standing ovations at places like Carnegie Hall for the past 20 years, as sassy as they ever were.", "critics_consensus": "The remarkable resilience, energy, strength, and charisma of these women captivate, and their experiences are a historical treasure.", "rating": "NR", "genre": "Documentary, Musical & Performing Arts, Special Interest", "directors": "Heather MacDonald", "writers": "", "cast": "Bertye Lou Wood, Cleo Hayes, Marion Coles, Fay Ray, Elaine Ellis, Geri Kennedy", "in_theaters_date": "2006-07-21 00:00:00", "on_streaming_date": "2006-11-21 00:00:00", "runtime_in_minutes": 81.0, "studio_name": "First Run Features", "tomatometer_status": "Fresh", "tomatometer_rating": 80, "tomatometer_count": 30, "audience_rating": 100.0, "audience_count": 961.0}, {"movie_title": "Every Act of Life", "movie_info": "The groundbreaking life and work of 4-time Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally - a personal journey through five decades of the American theatre, the struggle for LGBT rights, triumph over addiction, and finding love and inspiration at every age.", "critics_consensus": "", "rating": "NR", "genre": "Documentary", "directors": "Jeff Kaufman", "writers": "Jeff Kaufman", "cast": "F.

The geological team consists of two undergraduate students and two highly esteemed professors; though they are all but cut off from the rest of the world, they experience a tremendous sense of rapport and intimacy with one another, almost by default. The men and women also soak up the terrestrial splendor of the surrounding environs, yet struggle to adjust, emotionally, to the prospect of 24-hour sunlight.
