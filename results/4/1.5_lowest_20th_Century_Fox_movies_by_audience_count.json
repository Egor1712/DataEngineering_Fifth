[{"movie_title": "The Last American Hero", "movie_info": "Lamont Johnson's subtle direction graces this true-life success story about racecar driver Junior Jackson (Jeff Bridges), based on stock-car champion Junior Johnson. As a child in North Carolina, Jackson stays one step ahead of reform school until his father (Art Lund) is thrown in prison for moonshining. Seeing the error of his ways, Jackson begins to concentrate his driving skills, hoping to become a professional stock car racer to raise money to get his father released from jail. Jackson rises from the ranks into the highest rung of professional stock car racing, but Jackson finds his independent nature is compromised by the corporate realities of the professional sports world. The real Junior Johnson served as technical advisor on the film. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi", "critics_consensus": null, "rating": "PG", "genre": "Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Sports & Fitness", "directors": "Lamont Johnson", "writers": null, "cast": "Jeff Bridges, Valerie Perrine, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Ned Beatty, Gary Busey, Art Lund, Ed Lauter, Gregory Walcott, William Smith, Tom Ligon, Ernie F.

Vallanzasca was just nine years old when he and a group of mischievous friends snuck into a local circus to free a tiger, but that fateful day marked the beginning of a spectacular criminal career. Subsequently sent to a juvenile detention facility, Vallanzasca soon rounded up a gang comprised of familiar deviants upon his release, and quickly rose through the ranks of Italy's criminal elite. With the stunning Consuelo (Valeria Solarino) by Vallanzasca's side, not even San Vittore can hold the slippery desperado. And though Vallanzasca's gang would live the high life for a while, the impulsive leader would ultimately seal his own fate when he ruthlessly killed two policemen in a Dalmine tool booth. Having made a sworn enemy out of rival gangster Francis Turatello (Francesco Scianna), Vallanzasca strives to end the rivalry after being incarcerated in Rebibbia Prison. In and out of prison in the decades that followed, Vallanzasca found his life as a fugitive drawing to a close after reconnecting with his old friend Antonella D'Agostino (Paz Vega), whom he would later wed in a civil ceremony. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "critics_consensus": "", "rating": "R", "genre": "Art House & International, Drama", "directors": "Michele Placido", "writers": "Andrea Leanza, Kim Rossi Stuart, Carlo Bonini, Toni Trupia, Michele Placido, Antonella D'Agostino, Antonio Leotti", "cast": "Kim Rossi Stuart, Filippo Timi, Paz Vega, Moritz Bleibtreu, Valeria Solarino, Francesco Scianna, Gaetano Bruno, Nicola Acunzo, Stefano Chiodaroli, Lino Guanciale, Paolo Mazzarelli, Giorgio Careccia, Federica Vincenti, Monica Barladeanu, Marica Gungui, Lorenzo Gleijeses, Gerardo Amato, Adriana De Guinn", "in_theaters_date": "2011-06-17 00:00:00", "on_streaming_date": "2011-09-27 00:00:00", "runtime_in_minutes": 128.0, "studio_name": "20th Century Fox", "tomatometer_status": "Rotten", "tomatometer_rating": 50, "tomatometer_count": 24, "audience_rating": 49.0, "audience_count": 306.0}, {"movie_title": "Jannat 2", "movie_info": "Charismatic gun-runner Sonu (Emraan Hashmi) goes undercover for renegade cop Pratap (Randeep Hooda), and falls for a pretty doctor named Jhanvi (Esha Gupta) while working his way up the ladder of the treacherous black-market weapons trade. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "critics_consensus": "", "rating": "R", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense, Romance", "directors": "Kunal Deshmukh", "writers": "Shagufta Rafique", "cast": "Emraan Hashmi, Randeep Hooda, Esha Gupta, Manish Chaudhary, Imran Zahid", "in_theaters_date": "2012-05-04 00:00:00", "on_streaming_date": "2012-06-19 00:00:00", "runtime_in_minutes": 150.0, "studio_name": "20th Century Fox", "tomatometer_status": "Rotten", "tomatometer_rating": 0, "tomatometer_count": 6, "audience_rating": 45.0, "audience_count": 309.0}, {"movie_title": "London Fields", "movie_info": "Recently arrived in London in the hope of writing one last book before succumbing to a fatal illness, American author Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton) falls in with a cast of characters who just might give him the story he is looking for.

Of course, Ned and Keith want to possess her, but Sam sees something else-in Nicola he sees the heroine of the book he so desperately wants to write. Following her, studying her, and watching her become a different woman depending upon which man she is seducing, Sam starts weaving a tale, based on Nicola, or Nicola as he imagines her to be. He also discovers that the reason she lives like there's no tomorrow, is that she's fed up with her life and has secretly been plotting her own murder. Now that Sam knows the climax of his story, the only question is who will the murderer be?
